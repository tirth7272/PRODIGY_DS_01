#PRODIGY_DS_01
In this notebook, we analyzed a global population dataset to track demographic trends across different countries. After loading the data, we performed data cleaning to ensure consistency. We applied descriptive analysis to examine population growth over time, focusing on specific regions and timeframes. For visualization, we used line charts to depict population changes over the years and bar charts to compare population figures between countries. This helped us understand shifts in global demographics and identify countries with significant population increases.
